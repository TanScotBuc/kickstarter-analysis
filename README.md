# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
I was tasked with analyzing trends among previous Kickstarter campaigns in order to identify patterns and other information that might be useful in advising my client, Louise. Louise is Kickstarting her play *Fever* and would like to optimize her campaign for maximum possibility of success.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
According to the data collected there is a significantly higher number success for theater kickstarters that were launched in late spring. While campaigns launched in winter, particularly near the holidays, fared much poorer. Campaigns launched in December in particular had a failure rate of nearly 50%. Therefore I would advise Louise against a winter launch and strongly suggest starting in mid to late spring.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
There seems to be a negative correlation on the success rate as the campaign goals rise up to $25,000. However, I believe if there were more available data on campaigns over $25,000, that correlation might continue. There simply isn't enough data on the higher cost kickstarters to draw any meaningful conclusions.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenge I faced while doing this project trying to look into what the data was telling me and drawing my own conclusions as what it meant for my client specifically. I had to really think outsode the box to predict what the best course of action was given the data I was presented. I asked myself questions like: "What variables are the most relevent to my client?" and "What actions could she take to best put my analysis good use?"
## Results
-Launching a kickstarter near the holidays is a bad idea and a springtime launch will most likely see more success.
-Kickstarters tend to get funded more often if they ask for less money.
-Data on campaigns with goals higher than $25,000 seems to be scarce. Therefore, the conclusions drawn about these campaigns would be much less reliable.
-A graph comparing the average donation of successful campaigns vs failed ones could be insightful in deciding what income bracket to target with our kickstarter
